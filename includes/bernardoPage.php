    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>Born in Portugal in Mirandela on the 7/08/2001. Moved to Luxembourg when I was around the age of 6.
    Having to learn Luxembourgish at that time was not easy glady I had a portugese friend in my class that help me with all of that.
    Did most of my high school in the city called Grevenmacher. Where I used to live. Then we decided to move to a city called Petange. For the last Year that I lived in Luxembourg before
    moving to the Netherlands. Before that was my graduation of course. The past 4 years I spend in a high school called "Lycée des Arts et Métiers in Limpersberg Luxembourg.</p>
