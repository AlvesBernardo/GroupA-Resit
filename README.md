# GroupA-Resit
Term 1 resit. Ada Bilici, Bernardo Correia Alves, Iarina Dicu, Stefan Tasca
The assignment is as follows:

 

Create a website about the group you have been assigned. The mainpage should be about things you have in common. This could be hobbies, interests, likes and dislikes (There might be some relation between your home countries you can use for content?). The mainpage is a combined effort of all members of the group.

 

Next, every member creates their own individual page with information about themselves. You have a complete (individual) freedom on how to style this personal page and what content you would like to provide. The mainpage should contain style choices of all members combined (layout, use of color, fonts, etc.).

Use your knowledge of HTML en CSS to make it a properly scaling/responsive website.

 

This is a small assignment which could take you several hours. However be advised that this is to grade your usage of github. My advice would be to take about an hour a day to work on this assignment so that over the course of a week (or longer? Max 2 weeks) you’ll be able to build a ‘github history’ of your work on this assignmen
